# Tunde Kabir Mason's Pixel Art Maker Project

Hello,

This is my submission to the #7DaysOfCode Challenge as an ALC Learner on the Front-End Track of ALC 3.0 based on this [starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).

The app is written in pure javascript, no JQuery.

Hosted version here: https://tundekabirmason.github.io/pixel-art-maker/
